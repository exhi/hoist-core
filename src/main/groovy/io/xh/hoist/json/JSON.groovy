 * Alias for Grails JSON converter. Used for parsing JSON strings to Objects in Groovy.

 * In prior versions of this plugin, this class also supported customized serialization from Objects
 * to JSON. Applications should now use the Jackson-based JSONSerializer instead when writing JSON.
 *
 * This class is maintained here primarily for backwards compatibility; no future extensions or
 * modifications are currently planned.
