/**
 * Exception for use when the authenticated user does not have access to the resource in question.

 * This exception is thrown by Hoist's AccessInterceptor class if the user does not have roles
 * required by a controller's @Access annotation. Applications may also throw this exception, or
 * subclasses of it, directly in response to requests they cannot fulfill due to auth-related
 * constraints.
 *
 * Instances of this exception will be sent to clients with HttpStatus 403 ('Forbidden').
